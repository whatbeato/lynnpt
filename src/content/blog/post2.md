*dedicated to 3kh0, lou, neon, bunnyguy, angad, leo, rachel, deven, jared and every other single summer intern and gap year i met. even tho i might have annoyed you, thank you.*

hey there, welcome to lynn's "rant", i guess.
i'm just gonna go straight to the point

it's the 5th of may, 2025. i'm at my school, doing nothing in the robotics room, and i get a dm from jps. he asks "how do you consider yourself as a coder?"
i was honest, my knowledge still needs to be polished up, but yeah, i know how to code (proceeds to also send a video of the robotics room, because of a few hardware projects i've made)
"No worries. That is a great room, but Im more interested in whether or not you'll be able to be productive if you came to intern here at HQ this summer"

excuse me what. intern? at hack club? this dumb kid, interning?????? 

yes, i was chosen to be an intern ðŸ˜­, from all of the people that jared could choose, he chose me.
the next month leading up to the internship was basically:
- getting insurance taken care of
- getting my flights booked
- getting my ESTA
- preparing mentally (really hard)
- and getting my HCB account up!

also, delta was a fucking emotional rollercoaster. they:
- told me i couldn't book my flight
- booked my flight correctly?
- put in the wrong name and email???
- BOOKED THE WRONG FLIGHTS???
(this will only get better lmfao)

ok let's fast track until the 17th of June, 3 days before I travel to Burlington, VT

i got this message from jared:
"Mel was checking your account. Looks like you have $74 in it from those transfers. Will that be enough money for you for your first week?"
"I donâ€™t really know to be honest, but probably?"
(I WAS WRONG. REALLY WRONG. I WAS POOR ON THE FIRST DAY.)

18th of June. basically 2 days left

my letter of invitation for customs is all wrong, so i was waiting on deven to change it
jared also says: "i have one amazon package here for you".

19th of june nothing interesting happened. nervous as fuck.
i. was. extremely. nervous.
started overthinking a lot tbh, what if i had panic attacks (normal when i'm away from home), frequent mental breakdowns??
i started getting really scared to be honest, 
i considered cancelling everything. but i knew it was too late.

i blinked, and it was the 20th of june. departure day.
wake up at 6am. get to the airport at 9am.
FLIGHT GETS DELAYED UNTIL 13:30.
okay, ig. let's go over to check in.

check-in process takes about an hour, because the delta check in system wasn't working lmfao
they also gave me free food ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ - about 13.34EUR of free food. absolutely peak.
